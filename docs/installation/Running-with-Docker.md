# Running with Docker

We suggest using docker to install and launch openrouteservice backend. In short, run the following command under the source code tree will get everything done (for this please
clone the repository, running docker via the archive is currently not supported).

```bash
cd docker && docker-compose up
```

For more details, check the [docker installation guide](https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice/blob/master/docker/README.md).
